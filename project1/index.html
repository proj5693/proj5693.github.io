			Semiconductors were first introduced in 1947, the device was very advanced and revolutionary that its inventors received the Nobel Prize for physics. Semiconductors have become a very important piece of hardware that power’s the modern economy and enables it to function. A shortage in semiconductors can have devastating effects on the economy as it could undermine operations of many fields across industries and increase inflation rates which would hurt the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries. Semiconductors also impact the economy in many indirect ways which might not be visible at first when viewed from the surface, hence they aid in the development of a new disruptive phenomenon called the fourth industrial revolution which relies on semiconductors, another way semiconductors contribute to the economy indirectly is through the productions of many other goods and services which use or have semiconductor parts built in them. The semiconductor industry alone has grown to represent a large portion of the economy as it is one of the fastest growing industries in recent years, while also advancing other fields at the same time.

			Semiconductors are by definition “any of a class of crystalline solids intermediate in electrical conductivity between a conductor and an insulator” (Britannica, 1998). In recent months, businesses all around the globe experienced a crisis of shortage in semiconductors, which slowed or brought the modern economy to a halt. This affected the global economy in many ways such as undermining the operation of the automobiles industry, leading to the loss of billions of dollars as well as increasing inflation rates which had a negative effect on the GDP, across the globe. Manufacturers normally face difficulty meeting up with growing demand to produce semiconductors, mainly because making the advanced chips is an extremely difficult and intricate process since creating the necessary facilities to manufacture semiconductors and equipping them with the proper and latest equipment can take up to at least two years and millions of dollars which have to be poured into infrastructure, then roughly another 12 months is required to make the actual semiconductor from start to finish. To put that into perspective semiconductors undergo different phases of manufacturing through different companies each responsible for one part of the manufacturing process (CNBC, 2021). This has largely contributed to the shortage crisis, especially since trying to scale production by creating more outlets to meet the increasing demand takes a long time and a lot of resources. As a result of the semiconductor shortage crisis many industries have been affected and experienced the disruption of the global supply chain, one example is the automobile industry, due to the shortage many automakers weren’t able to accommodate or fulfil all of their orders for their vehicles since many automobiles require semiconductors as a vital piece of hardware for the manufacturing process and because there weren’t enough semiconductors, that resulted in many cars which were at their final stage of manufacturing to be uncompleted due to lack of semiconductors, which caused many companies across the industry to lose a total of roughly $110 billion in revenue (WSJ, 2021). Economists say that inflation could experience a momentary surge and as a result economic growth could slow down if the semiconductor shortage worsens, according to an article published by CNBC (Cox, 2021). The GDP of any country is the total value of goods and services produced by any country’s economy during a specified period of time, it is usually measured yearly (Britannica, 2006). The GDP is a key indicator used to measure any country’s economic growth and prosperity, since there is a negative correlation between inflation and GDP, when one increases the other decreases. Any healthy economy should have a GDP that gradually increases over time. However, due to the current semiconductor shortage, it has caused products to not be completed on time, as mentioned previously with the automobile industry example, due to that supply decreased, which led to an increase in prices of goods. According to a study done by Goldman Sachs, prices could increase as much as 3% for the bulk of 2021, meaning the inflation would rise as a result of increased prices, thus deteriorating economic growth (Cox, 2021). Therefore, it is safe to say that the role semiconductors play is significant, as they power the modern economy, hence as discussed, a shortage of semiconductors cost the automobile industry billions of dollars and resulted in higher inflation rates which increased prices of goods and as a result slowed economic growth.

			Semiconductors have a huge impact on the modern economy in many indirect ways that may not be visible if seen from the surface, hence they are a key technology in aiding what is known as the fourth industrial revolution, which is described by the executive chairman of the world economic forum, Klaus Schwab as “characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres” (Schwab, 2016) as well as account for 12% of output related products. The fourth industrial revolution will have a huge and monumental impact on the global economy that it won’t be easy to distinguish one effect from the next (Schwab, 2016). Just to name some of the many new and emerging technologies which will impact the modern economy through the fourth industrial revolution are artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, material science, energy storage and quantum computing (Schwab, 2016). All of these underlying technologies mentioned are the engine of economic growth and prosperity and would not be possible without semiconductors (RPC, 2021). Semiconductors are very vital to the economy hence they contribute significantly in many indirect ways, through aiding and making the technologies brought by the fourth industrial revolution possible and functional. Semiconductors make up about 0.3% of the U.S. GDP however, they are necessary to produce 12% of the GDP through other goods and products (Dusina, et al., 2021). This goes to show the importance of semiconductors on the economy, hence at first glance they might not account for a significant portion of the GDP, however as mentioned above they represent a far greater amount of the economy indirectly, through the production and output of other goods and services. Since many products and items use semiconductors to manufacture. Therefore, semiconductors are important to the economy as they help in aiding the progression of the fourth industrial revolution and the production of the output of a significant portion of the GDP.

			Semiconductors have contributed greatly to the modern economy in many ways, the semiconductor industry alone is worth billions of dollars, which keeps on growing at an expositional rate. Semiconductors have also given birth to many other industries which are worth a lot in their own right and have helped revolutionize many fields across different sectors of the economy. The semiconductor industry was estimated to be worth 439 billion dollars in 2020, which is already an increase of about 6.5% of the previous year (CNBC, 2021). If anything, this goes to show the significance of these small but advanced chips on the modern economy, since the industry has become very large and isn’t showing any signs of slowing its rapid growth, which in terms helps and aids the economic growth and development. Some of the many fields which were revolutionized because of semiconductors are communication, computing, healthcare which requires precise devices to perform sophisticated and complex tasks, military systems, transportation, energy, and many other countless areas where electronics are used (SIA, n.d.). Each of these fields where semiconductors are a necessary component for it to function, are all influenced by one another and link back to the economy, as they power its very existence. Therefore, semiconductors have grown to become a large part of the economy and fuel the development and help advance many other fields across many industries and sectors globally.

			In conclusion, it is easy to see how semiconductors have a huge significance on the global modern economy, as they are the very engine that powers the new emerging and revolutionary fields as well as the technologies of the future, in many indirect ways. While also contributing a great amount to the economy directly at the same time as semiconductors have proven to be a valuable commodity to possess during the shortage crisis and a shortage of semiconductors has detrimental effects on the functioning of the modern economy as it undermines many industries and results in an unhealthy increase in inflation rates which lead to a negative impact on any country’s GDP, thus the role of semiconductors on the modern economy is very vital and of great importance.
